# Research limitations

Stated plainly, because a benchmark that cannot say what it does not show is
not measuring much.

## The environment

One dimension. One moving dot. Deterministic, noiseless, fully observed
positions. Two dynamical laws: constant velocity with reflection, and a damped
harmonic oscillator. Both are analytically simple, and one of them —
constant-velocity motion with reflection — is *exactly* solved by a
parameterless baseline given the public boundary map. That is why the reflected
constant-motion baseline exists and why the bounce criterion is an absolute
accuracy requirement rather than a relative one.

## The learner

Three parameters. A linear map from `[1, scaled displacement, centered
position]` to the next normalized displacement. It has no explicit bounce
detector, no change detector that the evaluator informs, and no memory beyond
four positions and its own covariance state. It cannot represent a law outside
that family.

## What the results can and cannot support

These claims are kept separate, and none implies another:

1. the implementation runs correctly;
2. the model improves with experience;
3. what it learned generalizes to unfamiliar episodes;
4. continued updates help after a change;
5. it beats a baseline.

In particular:

- **Boundary handling is programmed, not learned.** Reflection is public
  knowledge of the observation format, supplied by the programmer.
- **The oscillator's pre-change dynamics are not held out.** The candidate is
  allowed to learn them from its own observations during the prefix. The
  post-change coefficients and the intervention are held out.
- **"Autonomous" means unattended.** The observe / predict / score / update loop
  runs without intervention after launch. It does not mean general
  intelligence, physical understanding, or independent goal formation, and
  nothing here is evidence for any of those.
- **Five training replicas is a routine engineering minimum**, labelled as such.
  Five checkpoints evaluated on 500 episodes is 500 episodes from five
  learners.

## What the benchmark has already refused

The first confirmation round under this protocol failed. Both fresh streams
failed `always_online_stability`: a continuously updating instance regressed
against the reflected constant-motion baseline, because it was fitting the one
window after each wall contact whose displacement feature is a folded
difference. That was repaired in the candidate, on development evidence, with
the failed attempts kept and no threshold touched.

Worth stating plainly: the thirteen gates that passed in that round include
every *frozen* track. The gate that failed is the only one that asks what
happens when the system is left running. That asymmetry is the most interesting
thing this version has measured.

## Known open items

- Raw per-step evidence is regenerable rather than durably archived
  (`AAA-077`).
- The always-online family rotates through a fixed sequence of the existing
  regimes; it is not an open-ended stream (`AAA-008`).

## The most useful next experiment

Controlled observation noise. Every current result depends on perfect
observations, which is exactly the condition under which an analytic
extrapolator is unbeatable and a learner has little to contribute. Fix a set of
noise levels, freeze the noise schedule and the confirmation plan before looking
at anything, and repeat the same matched frozen-versus-updating protocol. If
updating contributes under imperfect observation, that is a materially stronger
result than anything this version can establish.
